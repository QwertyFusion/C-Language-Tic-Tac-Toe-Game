## Codeblocks Installation Guide
1. Open Your Web Browser.
2. Click on this [link](https://www.codeblocks.org) or go to [https://www.codeblocks.org](https://www.codeblocks.org).
3. Click on the “Downloads” Section.
4. Click On “Download the binary release”.
5. As per this Date, download the Latest Version of Code Blocks. I’ll suggest you download the file with MinGW written on it (“codeblocks-20.03mingw-setup.exe”) as MinGW is a Compiler that is needed to run the Program.
   ```
    codeblocks-20.03-setup.exe : It is a standard executable file that is easier to install.
    codeblocks-20.03-nosetup.zip : It is a zip file which you do not have to install , you can just unzip and run it.
   ```
7. Click on Sourceforge.net under the Download Section of your desired file, then Download should begin within some seconds.
9. When the download is completed, Open Your Code Blocks Setup File.
10. Click on Next.
11. Click on I agree.
12. Click On Next (Requirement: 600 MB free storage for the installation).
13. Select your Destination and Click on Install.
14. Once Installation gets completed, click on Next and then Click on Finish

## Set the Environment Path of GCC compiler Guide
1. Go to your Code Blocks MinGW installation folder location ( For me it is C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin) and copy the address.
2. Go to Search Panel and type “Edit System environment variables”.
3. Click On Environment Variables.
4. Under System variables, Click on Path and Select Edit.
5. Click on New and Paste the Address into it and click  on OK.
